<p>To Find You</p>

<body>You were staring at your bedroom wall
With only ghosts beside you
Somewhere out where the wind was callin
I was on my way to find you
I was on my way to find you
And you were racing like a canonball
And roller skates and sky blue
Or in the backseat watchin the slow rain fallin
I was on my way to find you</body>
